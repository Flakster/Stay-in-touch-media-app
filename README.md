1. As a guest user:

   1. I want to be able to create account/log in.
   2. I can see only ‚ÄúSign in‚Äù and ‚ÄúSign out‚Äù page.

2. As a logged-in user:

   1. I want to be able to see all users list.
   2. I want to be able to see selected user page with their user name and all posts written by them (the most recent posts on the top).
   3. I want to be able to send a friendship invitation.
   4. I want to see a button ‚ÄúInvite to friendship‚Äù next to the name of user who is not my friend yet - on both users‚Äô list and single user page.
   5. I want to be able to see pending friendship invitations sent to me from other users.
   6. I want to be able to accept or reject friendships invitation.
   7. I want to be able to create new posts (text only).
   8. I want to be able to like/dislike posts (but I can like single post only once).
   9. I want to be able to add comments to posts.
   10. I want to be able to see ‚ÄúTimeline‚Äù page with posts (with number of likes and comments) written by me and all my friends (the most recent posts on the top).
